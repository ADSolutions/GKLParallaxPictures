GKLParallaxPictures
===================

**Heavy** inspiration drawn from <https://github.com/Rheeseyb/RBParallaxTableViewController> and <https://github.com/tapi/PXParallaxViewController>.  Much credit to both of those projects, as I probably wouldn't have had a good enough understanding of parallax without reading through their code.  I wanted a parallax view that had an image (UIPageControl) indicator, allowed you to add images after the view controller was initialized, and had a parallax effect while scrolling down instead of just while scrolling up (as Path does it).
